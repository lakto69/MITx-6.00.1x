0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
...

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,130
So we looked at adding labels, adding titles to our graphs.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,900
Good thing to do if we want to save them,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,358
we want to put them in a paper, we want to hang on to them,

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:10,840
look at them later on.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,020
But we started this discussion by saying we also

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,920
wanted to use the plotting or graphing

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,330
as a way of thinking about different kinds of results.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,360
We started that when we began plotting different functions

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,830
in different windows.

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,910
But even there, what I showed you earlier

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,050
could have been a bit misleading because it looked

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,240
like the linear graph and the exponential graph

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,444
grew at different levels.

14
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,110
But we didn't have a clear sense of that

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,610
because we didn't change the scales.

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,850
The scale on the y-axis for the linear graph

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,340
only went up to 30.

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,750
The scale on the y-axis for the exponential graph

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
went up 140,000.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,540
And we'd like to be able to better visualize differences.

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,660
So if the scales are different on the graphs,

22
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,400
how could we deal with that?

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,700
One option is to explicitly set limits on the axis.

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,840
Right now, we're just letting PiLab do that automatically.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,960
It figures out what's the maximum range of y-values,

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,660
and it sets the axis scale appropriately.

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,310
We could control it.

28
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,390
A second option is to actually plot multiple functions

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,550
on the same display, but to choose

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,599
which ones I want to display.

31
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,640
We did this earlier when we put all four together

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,473
and we saw that that wasn't really effective

33
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:19,206
because the smallest ones were too small.

34
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:20,580
But we're going to look at how we

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,450
might do a different way of doing that multiple display

36
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,200
to get a better sense of that kind of difference in scale.

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,070
So let's look at both of these.

38
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,080
Changing limits on the axes.

39
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,420
Here's the code, things we've been using as before.

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,670
Notice again, I'm going to get into that habit of just

41
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,810
clearing the frame before I deal with it.

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,130
And now, I can explicitly say, I want

43
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,985
to have the y limit go from 0 to 1000.

44
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm picking that number because I

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
happen to know what this display is going to look like.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,227
Some experimentation might let you decide an appropriate set.

47
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:56,560
But what you should see here is that when I am plotting,

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,290
I have the ability to explicitly set the range on the y-axis.

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,860
By the way, I could set the same thing on the x-axis.

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,080
And I don't have to show all of the values of the y

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,340
function or the x function, I could actually

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,810
pull out just a subset of it.

53
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,850
So in this case, I'm going to do a plot for the linear.

54
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,920
I'm going to do a plot for the quadratic, each

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,930
in their own frame.

56
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,480
But I'm going to set the y limit to be the same in both frames.

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,910
And then I label them.

58
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,660
And let's look at what happens when we do that.

59
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,650
This is actually quite nice.

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,100
Why is it nice?

61
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,290
Because now I can see what's the difference

62
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,260
between a linear function and a quadratic function.

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,660
We knew that the quadratic would grow more rapidly.

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,010
But now we get a sense of that difference,

65
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,830
because I've set it up so that both y-axes have

66
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,500
the same range.

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,430
Notice also, I picked a value that has a little bit of a gap

68
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,220
up here.

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,860
I happen to know that the y-values are

70
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,480
going to go up to about 800.

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,130
I could have lowered it down, but this

72
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,130
was a nice way of picking a range that was going

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,110
to let me see that difference.

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,310
From the perspective of visualizing data,

75
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,110
this is nice because now I can really

76
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,950
compare how quickly does quadratic

77
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,100
grow relative to linear while still seeing the difference.

78
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,480
What else might I do?

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,590
Well I can overlay the plots on top of one another,

80
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,870
but do it in a way where I actually pick which

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,580
ones I want to think about.

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,757
We saw earlier that trying to compare linear

83
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,340
against exponential is going to be a wash because you'll never

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,620
see the linear.

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,350
But now, I can go back to the idea of set

86
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,305
up a function or a frame, clear it.

87
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:39,240
And then in this case, let's plot two functions inside

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,940
of that frame, pick a second one,

89
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,160
clear it, and plot another two functions inside of that frame.

90
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,580
And if I do that, again, because I

91
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,630
am calling both of those plots inside of the same figure

92
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,865
they're going to overlay.

93
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,700
And because I'm calling the second pair

94
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,970
of plots inside the same frame, they're

95
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,110
going to get an overlay.

96
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,440
But I have a better way of doing the comparison.

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,860
And when I do that, I get the following display.

98
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,890
Now I can see the difference between linear and quadratic,

99
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,566
and I can see the difference between cubic and exponential.

100
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,310
And interestingly, you may not have

101
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,320
realized that cubic, early on, actually

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,420
grows a little bit faster than exponential.

103
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,329
But after some point, exponential

104
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,490
takes off and really overwhelms it.

105
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,910
Notice at the same time, I should

106
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,650
be careful about comparing these two graphs

107
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,360
because this one only goes up to 900,

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,520
that one goes up to 140,000.

109
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,222
Part of the message for you here--

110
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,680
if I want to compare things, I need

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,466
to think about what I'm comparing.

112
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,090
But it gives me a way of actually doing

113
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,560
that visualization in a very nice way.

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,900
So there are some times when I want to overlay things

115
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,880
on the same window, and other times

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,670
when I want to just have them displayed side by side.

117
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,350


118
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,620
I can do a couple of other things here.

119
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,960
Now that I'm starting to do other displays on top

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
of things, I could also add a legend

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,170
that helps me tell which plot is which.

122
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,670
If I go back to this window, you kind of know

123
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,770
which one's quadratic, which one's linear,

124
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,800
but I'd be handy to label them.

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
And I can do that.

126
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
And in particular, I can add in a label for a plot.

127
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,060
Here, I'm using the keyword label, and then

128
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,330
the equal sign, and then the specific label

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,740
to put on each one of them.

130
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,000
And I'm putting obvious labels here.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm going to label each one of these plots

132
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,960
so that now when I display them, I'm going

133
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,790
to get a nice display out.

134
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,630
One more thing before I do them.

135
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,790
I need to decide where am I going to put the legend.

136
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,480
And I could actually give it a location

137
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,860
by giving, under the plot function legend,

138
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,850
the keyword loc for location of upper left.

139
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,040
Or I could simply say, put the legend up,

140
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,160
but give it no argument and let PiLab decide what it thinks

141
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,622
is the best location to use.

142
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,080
Notice, by the way, that I need to do this because it's not

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,950
just that I put the label here.

144
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,520
I actually have to command PiLab to put a legend in for it

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,930
to appear.

146
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,330
OK, with that in mind, what does it look like?

147
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, kind of cool.

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,660
Remember I said use the upper left location.

149
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,750
There's the legend.

150
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,720
And now, each graph has a legend associated with it.

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,610
So I know that the blue line-- this one down here-- is linear,

152
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,480
and the green line is quadratic.

153
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,790
When I let PiLab decide where to place it,

154
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,630
it makes the decision that it thinks

155
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,680
is the best location to put it.

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,200
You might argue that in this case,

157
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,680
putting it in the upper right corner really

158
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,880
isn't great because it overlaps a little bit of the graph.

159
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,910
It might have been better to put it over there.

160
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,820
But we leave it up to PiLab to decide where to place it.

161
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,800
And again, now I know that this is the cubic,

162
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
and that is the exponential because the legend tells me

163
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,280
that right there.

164
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,060
So that's great.

165
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,750
I can start adding more information to the plots

166
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,620
that I'm using.
