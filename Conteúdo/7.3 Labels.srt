0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
...

1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,890
Now that we have the idea of being

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,570
able to do different plots in different windows,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,390
we'd like to see what other things could we add to this.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,100
And the first thing is, I should really label things here.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,060
I should really label the axes, because they

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,870
mean different things in different plots.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,480
So here's a set of code all calling functions out

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,560
of that PiLab library.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,110
And notice what I've done.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,400
First of all, I open up a figure that I'm

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,320
going to call lin for linear.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,290
And the next two calls are putting

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,119
an x and y label on that graph.

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,780
They just take string arguments.

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,250
So I'm going to say, on the x-axis,

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,950
I want to say sample points.

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,370
On the y-axis, I'm just going to say linear function.

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,560
Obvious things to put in there.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,590
I then do the plot of my samples versus my linear,

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,340
as we did before.

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,074
I can open up, as I did before, another figure, quadratic,

22
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:51,990
and do plotting there.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,240
I could open up another figure which is cubic

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,720
and do plotting there.

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,111
I could open another figure and do exponential plotting.

26
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:00,486
And then I might decide, you know

27
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:02,910
what, I want to go back to the quadratic figure

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,200
and add a label.

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,912
So notice here, having first created the quad figure there,

30
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:10,120
I've done a few other things.

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,370
I can come back right here and say, please

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,370
reopen the quad figure.

33
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,640
Calling figure with the same name will do that.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,960
And inside of that window, I'm going to add in another label.

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,660
I'm going to put in a y label that is

36
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,940
a quadratic function on there.

37
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,838
Let's see what happens if we do this.

38
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,830
Oh, nice.

39
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,370
Now I've got something that labels the x-axis, that

40
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,750
labels the y-axis.

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,770
And I'll wait a minute.

42
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,270
Over here, what happened?

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,400
There's no label on the x-axis.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,012
There is a label on the y-axis.

45
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,470
Let's go back to the previous slide

46
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,650
and see why that happened.

47
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,880
Ah.

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,550
Notice that here, I put an x and y label.

49
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,310
But that was in the linear window.

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,190
Down here, when I reopened up the quad picture,

51
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,166
I only put a y label on.

52
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,290
And that makes sense, then.

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,620
I only said put a y label on there.

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,870
The label for x happened up here only inside

55
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,530
of the linear window, not inside of the quad window.

56
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,080
And so I want to fix that, I better

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,930
make sure I do the labels inside of the appropriate windows.

58
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,100
There is my display.

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,420
And it comes out quite nicely.

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,625
OK, what else might I do?

61
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,000
If I'm really careful about this,

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,270
I should not only label x and y-axes.

63
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,800
I should also put titles on these graphs.

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,810
And so I can do that by simply adding.

65
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,470
And after I've done all of these pieces.

66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,040
Opening up the figure, doing the plots, I could put in labels.

67
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,330
And notice here, I'm reopening up each one of the figures,

68
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,190
and then putting an appropriate label

69
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,920
for the title of each one of these graphs.

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,150
Great, Let's see what happens when we do that.

71
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,170
So there's the display.

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,450
And there's good news and bad news.

73
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,560
The good news is, there are the titles for the graphs

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,210
that I drew.

75
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,520
But notice I've still got some labels on the axes.

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,950
And in that previous code, if I go back to it just

77
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,540
for a second, they're not there, right?

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm opening up a figure, I'm plotting.

79
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,080
I'm opening up a figure, I'm plotting.

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,010
And then I'm putting titles on.

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,500
So what happened here?

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,280
Why are the axes still labeled?

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,780
And the other thing you might notice

84
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,387
is, why are the colors the same in the two plots?

85
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,720
They're both of the same color, even though I'm actually

86
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,640
plotting different things.

87
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,170
So let's answer both of those.

88
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,790
The first answer is, or the answer to the first question

89
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,810
is, we're reusing a previously created window.

90
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,497
I had done earlier calls where I created those windows

91
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,830
with those names, and I'd done things in them, including

92
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,040
putting labels on the axes.

93
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,160
So if I want to really be clean, I

94
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,715
should clear the window before redrawing it.

95
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:56,874
And I'll show you how to do that in a second.

96
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,540
And the second one, if you're wondering,

97
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,924
is why are these plotting functions using the same color?

98
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,340
We're going to fix it in a second.

99
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,950
But basically, we're calling a plot

100
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,810
in a new version of a window.

101
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,380
And PiLab always starts with the same choice of color,

102
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,030
and then we'll move on as we do other kinds of plots.

103
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,630
As we'll see, we can control it.

104
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,690
But if we don't give any specific instructions,

105
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,709
PiLab's always going to start with the same color.

106
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,900
Let's deal with cleaning up the windows first.

107
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,690
So what I need to do is to say to PiLab,

108
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,800
when I open up a figure, in case I've

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
had an earlier version of it open previously, I'm going to,

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,830
in fact, clear it.

111
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,810
And it's simply going to use the CLF,

112
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,340
or clear the frame function inside of each one.

113
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,990
And it's a nice habit to get into.

114
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,502
I open up a window, let me clear it

115
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:45,460
to make sure I haven't been using it previously

116
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,500
somewhere else.

117
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,510
And I have exactly what I want set

118
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,142
in order to have a clean slate.

119
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,350
Of course sometimes, I may want to use it previously.

120
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,610
And in fact, we'll see that right here

121
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,960
on this side when I want to put labels in.

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm reopening that for window and doing

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,730
the appropriate labeling inside of it.

124
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,490
But with that clear, I'm actually

125
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,100
going to be able to draw appropriately

126
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,380
inside each of them.

127
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,470
And when I do that, I get the display I want.

128
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,440
Titles, in this case, on the windows,

129
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,482
but nothing on the axes.

130
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,190
And I should have said earlier, of course

131
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,650
there were actually four windows that were displayed here.

132
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm just showing two of them, the linear and quadratic.

133
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,030
I didn't bother to show to you the cubic and the exponential.

134
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,700
But those are going to be things that would also be displayed.

135
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,090
If I wanted to look at them.
