0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
...

1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,890
So we've seen we can overlay plots.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,730
We can do plots side by side in different windows.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,400
We can control the scales on the axes

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,650
in order to zero in on how we want

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,570
to do comparisons of displays.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,530
We can add labels.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,450
We can add legends.

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,590
We can add titles.

9
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,390
We're in good shape.

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,370
Let's think now about how we might actually

11
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,120
control even more of the parameters

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,830
of the different displays in order

13
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,520
to better highlight different aspects of what

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,100
we're trying to plot.

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,220
So we might want to change the color

16
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,780
ourselves of what we're drawing in

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,820
or the style of the datasets.

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,880
We might want to change the width of the lines

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,220
to highlight one more strongly than another.

20
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,415
And we might actually want to do subplots inside of a plot.

21
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,040
Let's look at all three of these things

22
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,410
as different ways of using plots to visualize data.

23
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,995
I'm going to start with changing the data display.

24
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,770
And in particular, I'm going to go back to my similar examples.

25
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,020
There's a lot of code here, but we've seen most of it.

26
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,580
I'm going to open up a comparison of a window that's

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,350
going to compare linear and quadratic.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,717
I'm going to clear it as I did before.

29
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,300
And now when I'm going to do the plot,

30
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,050
I'm going to add in one more piece.

31
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm again plotting my samples against linear or my samples

32
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,650
against quadratic.

33
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,870
We've seen the labels, as before.

34
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,120
The new thing I've added here are

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,910
strings that specify the color and the style on which I

36
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,880
want to do the display.

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,210
They're a little terse.

38
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,282
That's OK.

39
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,990
I'll let you go look at the documentation

40
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,830
to see your choices.

41
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,570
But the first part of the string says what color to use.

42
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,850
B, I believe, is Blue.

43
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,230
R is Red.

44
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,740
G is Green.

45
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,370
R, again, is red.

46
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,440
K is black, for reasons I don't know,

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,380
but the designers of pylab do.

48
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,140
Basically you can look up the choices of those.

49
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,520
The second part of the string lets

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,600
us decide how we're going to do the display.

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,080
So a single dash is a line.

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040
A 0 is a circle.

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,020
A little upper arrow or caret is a triangle.

54
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,420
And two dashes is literally a dash.

55
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,300
The idea is that the third argument

56
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,700
is going to let you specify a string that says, here's

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,520
the color and style to use.

58
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,710
I can still add in other keywords like "label"

59
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,229
to override this.

60
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,729
With that in mind, let's see what

61
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,124
happens if we do the display.

62
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,930
Hah, cool.

63
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,180
And notice, by the way, the legends nicely reflect this.

64
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,380
They also say, here is what we're displaying here.

65
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,420
So now I've got a dotted line compared to a straight line.

66
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,660
I've got a dashed line compared to a sequence of triangles.

67
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,380
I'll let you do the exploration of other kinds of variations

68
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,310
you could try here.

69
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,950
But you've got some control in how

70
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,177
you want to highlight how you're actually visualizing things.

71
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,510
In a little while, we're going to come back and use this

72
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,170
as an example to see how this is really handy to capture

73
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,240
different aspects of data.

74
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,740
But you can see I've got the ability

75
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,120
to change the visualization.

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,770
So I can change the style in which I display things.

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,090
What else could I change?

78
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,530
The second thing I could change would be actually the line

79
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,560
width-- if you like, how thick a pen

80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,020
or how thin a pen am I using to draw these?

81
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,170
And here you can see I'm simply adding

82
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,780
in now one more keyword-- "linewidth," not surprisingly--

83
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,210
and I'm giving it a size from 2, 3, 4, and 5.

84
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,484
This is referring to the size of the pixels,

85
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,900
if you like, on the graph that I'm

86
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,810
using to do the display Everything else here is

87
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,350
the same as before.

88
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,380
Let's see what happens when I do that.

89
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,880
Yeah.

90
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,150
Very nice.

91
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,930
Now you can see again the legend picks it up.

92
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,130
Notice over here, exponential is being--

93
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,050
is a very thick line compared to cubic, compared to quadratic,

94
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,534
compared to linear.

95
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,200
And it's simply another example of being

96
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,550
able to change the aspects of the display to highlight things

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,640
I want to highlight.

98
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,430
I could have pick something different.

99
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,260
This is just a nice way of showing it off.

100
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,690
The last thing I want to show you

101
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,780
in terms of controlling displays takes

102
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,960
a little bit of explanation, and that is to use subplots.

103
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,220
So some of this is as before-- creating a figure,

104
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,420
I'm clearing it.

105
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,570
But now I'm going to give it a call to subplot.

106
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,530
And the subplot takes as arguments

107
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,930
three numbers which will look a little bit interesting.

108
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,410
So let me tell you what those three numbers are.

109
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,030
Those arguments are the number of rows

110
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,440
and the number of columns inside of the plot

111
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,100
and then which location to use.

112
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,620
So on these top two, I'm basically saying, inside

113
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,370
of this figure-- same figure-- I want you to display something

114
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,670
with two rows and one column, so two graphs like this.

115
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,980
Down here, I'm saying, do something

116
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,599
with one row and two columns, so something

117
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,890
that's going to look like that.

118
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,740
We'll see that in a second.

119
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,360
And then the third argument is saying, which location am I

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,877
using in terms of that display?

121
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,460
I'm going to do one other things here.

122
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
I'm going to go back to that idea of controlling

123
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,890
the range or the limit on the y-axis,

124
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,170
because I know that these are of different sizes-- in this case,

125
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,910
setting it to 900; down here, setting it to 400.

126
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,710
And with that in mind, I'm going to actually go

127
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,390
ahead and do the display.

128
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,360
Now notice I've got a call to ylim after each of the subplots

129
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,370
in order to try and do that kind of a display.

130
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,391
I'm setting the limit within each subplot.

131
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't have to always do that, but that's a handy way

132
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,514
to just make sure I'm being careful about how

133
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm doing those kinds of plots.

134
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,940
OK.

135
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,590
Let's see what it looks like.

136
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,030
Ah, exactly as I described-- in the first case,

137
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,420
I've got one column and two rows.

138
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,900
In the second case, I've got one row and two columns.

139
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,640
And the reason I picked setting the limits

140
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,520
is so we can see the comparison here in the growth,

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
because it's the same y in both of these cases.

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,670
And similarly, over here, I've picked the same y

143
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,884
for both of those cases.

144
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,550
You can also see a personal choice here.

145
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,900
I don't particularly like this style,

146
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,920
because I started getting overlaps of values

147
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,940
on top of the actual graphs.

148
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,130
I find this comparison a little bit better to use,

149
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,710
but it's your choice.

150
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,630
The main point is, I've got the ability

151
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,837
to compare things side by side or top to bottom.

152
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,420
My choice, but another way of thinking

153
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,000
about using aspects of plotting to visualize the data.

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,380
Now we've seen a lot of examples of actually doing

155
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,610
different things, looking at these different-- four

156
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,740
very simple orders of growth-- linear, quadratic, cubic,

157
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,410
and exponential.

158
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,430
Let's now switch gears and think about using

159
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,870
the tools we've seen here to actually think about,

160
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,920
how do I visualize data, and think

161
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,780
about computation as part of that visualization process.

162
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,170
Before we get to that idea of doing that visualization,

163
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,669
though, let's look at one last thing

164
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,890
that we can do in terms of changing things here,

165
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,780
and that's to change the scales.

166
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,250
And changing the scales here basically

167
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,110
says, if I've got something that actually grows really rapidly,

168
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,560
rather than plotting them linear and linear,

169
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,460
I could plot them where one of the axes

170
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,510
is done on a log scale.

171
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,600
And I use the call y-scale, giving it the argument log,

172
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
to tell me that I want to use a log

173
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,560
scale rather than a linear scale as I do this actual plotting.

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
Everything else is as before.

175
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,430
Now when I plot them, I can see I

176
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,650
can compare simply linear comparison

177
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,800
against logarithmic comparison here.

178
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,450
The reason this is handy is something like exponential

179
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,320
grows so quickly that it really swamps out things very rapidly.

180
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,800
And you can actually see here, even with this rapid rise, when

181
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,030
I plot things on a log scale, which

182
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,960
is each incremental step here is an increase

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,310
of an order of magnitude, I get a different way of seeing these

184
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,920
so that now the exponential is linear on a log scale,

185
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,560
as it should be, and the cubic starts

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,270
to drop off much more rapidly.

187
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,270
So that idea of being able to change scales

188
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,970
lets me focus in on orders of growth in a different way.
