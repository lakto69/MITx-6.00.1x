0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
...

1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,476
We've now seen different uses of plots.

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:05,350
We've been mostly comparing orders of growth,

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,060
which we've seen before.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,300
I wanted you to see the idea of how plotting

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,430
lets you visualize data.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,100
And now I want to turn to a variation of that, which

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,910
is to think about, how can we actually use

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,350
that visualization of results to help guide computation, to help

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,400
guide the values of parameters we might want to pass in

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,470
or the kinds of things we want to explore inside

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,260
of a computation?

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,310
To do this, I want to use a simple little example.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,580
Imagine you're planning a retirement.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,330
You want to think about making sure you've

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,954
got enough money saved away so that you

16
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,650
can retire at the age you want.

17
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,800
Let's look at, basically, how a retirement fund grows

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,119
with compounding of interest.

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,410
And I'm going to do it with the following simple little

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,550
example.

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm going to plan to set aside a particular amount.

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,260
Let's call it m every month out of my salary,

23
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,955
save it away in a retirement account.

24
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,580
I also expect that I'm going to earn a little interest in that.

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,350
I'm going to invest it in some stocks or bonds or C-Bills

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,360
or something else.

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,550
So I'm going to expect to earn a percentage

28
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,390
r of additional income every month

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,470
on the investments I set up.

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,710
And I want to explore, how big is my retirement fund going

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,670
to be when it compounds over time

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,680
with both new contributions each month and accrual of interest

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,389
each month so that I can decide when I want to retire?

34
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:23,930
How much do I need to have before I'm

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,070
ready to actually retire?

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,720
Let's look at how we might both write code to do that,

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,280
and especially how we can visualize

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,190
results to think about how I want to do that computation.

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,320
Well, let's start with just something that

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,510
computes compound interest.

41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,070
I've written a little procedure here called Retire.

42
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,820
It takes in three arguments-- the amount

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,900
I'm going to put aside each month,

44
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,330
the rate at which I'm going to earn interest or, if you like,

45
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,630
grow my income through investments on it,

46
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,310
and how many months or terms I want to compute over,

47
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,000
how many terms do I want to look at before I'm

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,360
ready to look at retirement.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,420
This function should not surprise you.

50
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,470
It does things you've seen before.

51
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,110
I'm going to set up a list called Savings.

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,930
I want to set up a list called The Base.

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,070
That's going to be my y and x values, if you like.

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,890
I'm going to compute the monthly rate.

55
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,510
That's just the annual rate, but every month, so

56
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,310
divide it by 12.

57
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,530
And then I have a simple little for loop here

58
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,980
that runs over the range of the number of terms,

59
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,480
so however many times I want to look at this.

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,780
And it just adds into each of those lists

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,290
the next label for the x-axis, so the next month.

62
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,010
And then the savings computation is a little bit different.

63
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,690
I take the value of savings the previous month,

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,380
and I add to it something that adds in the extra rate.

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,770
So it's multiplying by 1 plus the monthly rate, which says,

66
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,270
I've got the savings from last time,

67
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,190
plus I've got a little bit more because I've

68
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,320
earned a little bit more interest off of it.

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,280
And then to that updated value in my savings,

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,390
I add in the new monthly contribution.

71
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm building up two lists, and I'm simply

72
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,480
going to return those-- a base list, which gives me

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,750
the x labels, if you like, and a savings list, which gives me

74
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,497
the y labels.

75
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:16,080
This shouldn't look surprising to you.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,210
This is just a standard little accrual

77
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,410
of values in a list of a compound interest

78
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,060
plus a new contribution each month.

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,160
What I want to look at is, how do I visualize that?

80
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,510
So I'm going to use Retire to compute those two lists.

81
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,215
And notice, by the way, I'm returning both of them.

82
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:32,840
It's very nice.

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,150
I'm going to use that in a second.

84
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,375
Now I'd like to display that.

85
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,590
And I'm going to start by looking at something that's

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,220
going to display the different growths in retirement accounts

87
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,604
as I change how much I put aside each month.

88
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,020
I'm going to call this the display

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,840
retirement with monthlies.

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,890
It's going to take in an argument that

91
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,220
is a list of different amounts to set aside each month, a rate

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,065
and terms as before.

93
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:01,030
And I'm going to start setting up to do the plotting.

94
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,050
So I'm going to create a figure with a name.

95
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,820
I want to clear it, as I did before,

96
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,623
to make sure that in fact I'm going to be able to reuse it.

97
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,630
So I'm going to clear that out.

98
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,310
And then I'm going to run over a loop.

99
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,040
And the loop is going to, in that list of different monthly

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,209
values, select a new value and run Retire.

101
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,350
I'll remind you it said it returned two things.

102
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,140
So I'm going to get back out the x values and the y values.

103
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,950
And now I'm just going to plot them, just as I did before.

104
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,252
Great-- I'm going to plot x values and y values.

105
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,710
The one other thing I'm going to do

106
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,890
is I'm going to put in a nice label on here that actually

107
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,460
says, the label is, I'm retiring.

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,320
And I'm going to put in there what monthly

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,090
rate I was setting aside so I know how

110
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,830
to associate different graphs with the different amounts set

111
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,722
aside.

112
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:47,180
And when I'm done with all of that,

113
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,910
notice this is going to be a loop.

114
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,182
So I'm plotting different versions here.

115
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:52,640
When I'm done with all of that, I'm

116
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,990
going to put the legend up in the upper left corner.

117
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,410
Let's try it out.

118
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,050
I'm going to try it out with a monthly rate

119
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,700
of 5%-- nice and healthy.

120
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm going to take 40 years of contributions.

121
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,110
So I've got 40 times 12, because I'm

122
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,590
plotting these at each month.

123
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,279
So that's the total number of terms.

124
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,820
And I'm going to look at what happens

125
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,060
when I decide to put different amounts aside

126
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,720
each month from $500 up to $1,100 each month.

127
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,450
And if I do that plot-- ah, nice.

128
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,960
Now, the legend is a little big here.

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,200
I stuck it in a corner where I know it would show up.

130
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,040
But the labels are valuable.

131
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,480
Because they tell me, how do I correspond each color

132
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
to the different graph?

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,230
And you see the growth, the exponential growth,

134
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,240
that you would expect here as I slowly

135
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,110
grow up each one of these different terms.

136
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,890
So I've got a set of graphs over here.

137
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,790
I can see what those differences are.

138
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,790
I might want to zero in on those a little bit

139
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,570
to look at some things about each one of those pieces

140
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,420
in order to decide which one is better for me.

141
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,890
And in particular, I can see the impact of increasing

142
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,190
the monthly contribution.

143
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,560
I get things that range from about $750,000 to almost $1

144
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,270
and 2/3 million as a monthly savings go from $500 to $1,100.

145
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,130
Again, my point was to look at, how do the visualizations help

146
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,100
me think about the computation?

147
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,830
This lets me see the range of growth

148
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,770
as I change the monthly component.

149
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,760
What's the effect of the rate of growth on the investments?

150
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,230
Well, I could do the same thing.

151
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,190
I could write another function, display retirement now

152
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,460
with rates.

153
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,990
And here, I'm going to give in a list of different rates.

154
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm going to pick a particular monthly contribution.

155
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,630
I'm going to give it a set of terms to look at.

156
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,040
And the rest of this looks much like before.

157
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,239
Again, I'm going to put a label on here that lets me understand

158
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,030
what I'm capturing.

159
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,820
So notice it's got the string Retire.

160
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,572
It's got the monthly rate.

161
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:50,030
And I'm also going to put something

162
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,600
in here that tells me the actual rate of investment growth

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,730
so that I can associate each of those pieces with the graph.

164
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,650
I'm going to give it a particular argument.

165
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,441
I took something about in the middle, $800.

166
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm going to give it three different ranges of growth

167
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,930
in terms of investment rate.

168
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,720
And again, I'm going to give it the same number of terms.

169
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,050
And now if I do the graph, I see that there's

170
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,240
a different variation in the exponential growth.

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Here, varying the rate of growth of the investment return

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,660
actually tends to spread out more rapidly the actual graphs

173
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,570
that we see here.

174
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,390
But again, I can now start seeing the range of variation

175
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,040
here.

176
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,140
I can see that in fact if I can have something

177
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,560
with an aggressive growth-- and hoping for 7%

178
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,180
is probably being a little bit optimistic here--

179
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,520
I actually end up with a much better range in terms

180
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,910
of the total amount I've got in my retirement account

181
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,260
when I'm ready to retire-- sounds nice.

182
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,690
So here I can see the impact on a different dimension.

183
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,250
Now it goes from about $600,000 to almost $2.1 million.

184
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,022
OK, I want to look at both rates together.

185
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,480
What happens if I both think about,

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,992
I want to change how much I'm setting aside each month,

187
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,950
and, I'm going to be conservative or aggressive

188
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,908
in what I want to do in terms of my investments

189
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,150
to decide how to get growth in terms

190
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,830
of my actual overall retirement account?

191
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,050
So I can do both at the same time.

192
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,524
It's a little bit more messy code.

193
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:14,940
But you've seen both pieces of it.

194
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,260
Now I'm going to have a list of monthly rates.

195
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,810
I'm going to have a list of different rates in terms

196
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,750
of what I expect of the return on investment, saying,

197
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,700
am I conservative or aggressive in how I do all of this?

198
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,950
I'm going to set up a figure with an appropriate label

199
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,449
on it.

200
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,260
I'm going to clear it out.

201
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,610
I'm actually now going to zero in on just the high end

202
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,725
of the range.

203
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,000
And here I probably should have, rather than

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,520
giving it explicit values, looked at the range of terms

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,120
and set it up.

206
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,203
But I happen to know what I was going to use here.

207
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:49,070
So I'm just going to look at the last 10 years of investment

208
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,980
on these pieces.

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,770
So I'm going to literally separate out

210
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,995
the x limit on that.

211
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:56,890
Ah, notice-- previous examples I set the y limit.

212
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,460
Here I'm choosing the x limit, the x-axis,

213
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,130
and just zeroing in on one piece of it.

214
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,300
The last piece of it is I'm now going to loop twice.

215
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,590
I'm going to loop over how much to set aside each month.

216
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,230
And for each of those choices, I'm

217
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,960
going to loop over different rates of return.

218
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,630
As before, I'm going to set up a label.

219
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,630
And that label is going to help me out.

220
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,310
And now I'm going to look at four different monthly rates,

221
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,100
three different returns.

222
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,527
And let's see what happens when we do that graph.

223
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,610
And I should've said that.

224
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm just going to focus on that last stage of the fund.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,630
And if I do that, and I put on the appropriate label,

226
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,700
I get-- yuck.

227
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,820
Well, the labels help me here.

228
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,600
They tell me what's going on.

229
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,020
Zeroing in on just the last 10 years was probably valuable.

230
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,136
Because it lets me spread these out.

231
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,990
But it's a little hard to figure out which of these graphs

232
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,360
is corresponding to which color.

233
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,370
So I ought to be able to fix that so I can really see more

234
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,270
appropriately the comparison.

235
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,470
And I remind you, that was one of the points.

236
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,680
How do I use the visualization to help me decide how

237
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,500
to think about the computation?

238
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,760
Here there's too much overlay of the graphs.

239
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,520
How can I separate those out into pieces

240
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,480
that would really help me think about this a little bit better?

241
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,570
So let's do that.

242
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,370
I can't distinguish because of the overlap of the graphs.

243
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,460
I could just analyze them separately.

244
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,580
But I can also be careful about how

245
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,720
I want to visualize the different effects.

246
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,480
And I'm going to do that in the following way.

247
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,500
As before, I'm going to set up a graph,

248
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,420
clear it out, focus in on the last 10 years of all of this.

249
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,040
But I'm going to do a couple of other things.

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,200
The first one is I'm going to create a set of labels.

251
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,560
I'm going to create a set of monthly labels--

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,100
r, b, g, and k for red, blue, green, and black.

253
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm going to set up a set of rate labels.

254
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,420
And I'm going to now use-- notice-- the color to tell me,

255
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,970
what was the monthly contribution?

256
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,680
And I'm going to use the style of display-- solid line,

257
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,350
circle, dash line, for example-- to tell me

258
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,530
how I want to actually visualize the different rates.

259
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,730
Inside of those loops, I'm going to select out

260
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,910
a month label by doing the following wonderful little

261
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,040
trick.

262
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,180
I pick out a monthly rate from that list of monthlies.

263
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,160
And to get that month label, I'm simply

264
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,570
going to take the remainder after dividing

265
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,100
by the number of those pieces to tell me which label to use.

266
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,080
So it's going to walk through the labels one at a time.

267
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,801
And if I have more choices than I have actual labels,

268
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,300
it will cycle back to the beginning.

269
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,210
But this is going to let me select out the label.

270
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,060
I'm going to do the same thing with the rate label.

271
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm going to pick it using the remainder function so that I

272
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,520
cycle through those choices.

273
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,810
And then when I do the display, I

274
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,900
should get something that better separates out

275
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,400
the visualization.

276
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,365
So let's see if that actually happens.

277
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,490
I'm going to create that label by putting those two

278
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,970
pieces together.

279
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,050
Remember, to do the label, I need both a color and a style.

280
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,670
And so by putting those two pieces together as a string,

281
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,210
that's going to give me the piece I'd like.

282
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,296
And there we go.

283
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:18,670
This may still look messy to you.

284
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,090
But this is actually nice.

285
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,690
Because notice, the color all corresponds.

286
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,650
For example, red is all $500.

287
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,030
Blue is all $700.

288
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,960
So the color tells me very nicely,

289
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,510
what was the monthly rate?

290
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,340
And the style-- solid line, circle, dash line--

291
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,230
tells me whether it was a return of 3%, 5%, or 7%.

292
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,730
And while there's still a little bit

293
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,270
of overlay between these graphs, it's now easier

294
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,630
to see, what's the impact?

295
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,242
Which one has a bigger impact?

296
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:52,700
In fact, it's being more aggressive

297
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,110
about your investments that has the bigger impact.

298
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,380
Because that shifts things up much more rapidly

299
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,840
than basically how much I set aside each month.

300
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,720
You can see that the slant of the line,

301
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,120
if you like, up here with the three-- or the four, actually.

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,370
I should have done that right.

303
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,270
The four dash lines is much better

304
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,580
than the slant of the line down here with the four solid lines.

305
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,130
And that was my original point.

306
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,590
I want to be able to visualize and use the visualization

307
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,820
to guide the computation.

308
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,342
And this says, start saving early for retirement.

309
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,050
Because you really want to do that to get

310
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,310
that wonderful compound interest rather than relying on getting

311
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,010
a 25% return each year.

312
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,990
Because that suggests that somebody

313
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,980
has convinced you to invest in a Ponzi scheme,

314
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,820
and it's not a good idea.

315
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,420
Whatever you do for your own retirement, you get the idea.

316
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,760
I can visualize the data.

317
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,240
I can use that visualization to guide the computation.

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,360
And so that nicely leads to this summary.

319
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,910
It's now easier to see the grouping of the plots.

320
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,000
Color encodes, in this case, monthly contribution.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
Format-- solid, circle, dash-- encodes the rate of growth

322
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,470
that I chose for the investment.

323
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,630
And more particularly, as you saw with this example,

324
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,770
I can interact between the plotting routine

325
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,900
and the computation to explore the data.

326
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,461
I can change the display range to zero in on a particular area

327
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:10,960
of interest.

328
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,430
In this case, it was the last 10 years.

329
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,290
I can change the set of values and visualize the effect.

330
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,410
And that then guides a new choice of values to explore.

331
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,820
What if I wanted to look at different rates of return?

332
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,230
What if I wanted to look at different monthly rates?

333
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,550
And finally, I could change the display parameters

334
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,520
to highlight how to cluster plots by parameter.

335
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,920
If you choose to take the second half of this course,

336
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,150
you're going to see lots of nice examples of using plotting

337
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,850
to visualize data to think about what

338
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,970
it says about a computation.

339
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,850
But we also wanted you to see an example of using a library.

340
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,350
And notice throughout this entire lecture, all I did

341
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,510
was use a set of functions so I could look up inside of PiLab.

342
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,160
That lets me rely on somebody having written code I can use

343
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,290
and using that library, a tool you're

344
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,595
going to use a lot as you move on in your own computation.

345
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:00,095
