00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
...

1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,020
So far we've just been typing things into our Python shell.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,630
And for simple expressions, that's OK.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,450
But it's even there a little bit painful.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,450
And when we want to do things that we might like

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,030
to run multiple times or when we want to do things

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,140
with multiple commands, we'd really like a better way

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,530
to deal with that.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,250
And for that, we'd like to have a text editor.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,010
Just like an editor you'd use for writing Word documents,

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,440
we'd like an editor into which we can type Python expressions.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,530
And in most cases that comes as part of something

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,950
called an IDE, an integrated development environment.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,900
I happen to be using one from Anaconda.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,730
IDLE's another version of it.

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,990
And that IDE comes both with a text editor into which I

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,100
can enter things, I can edit them,

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,074
and I can save them away, a shell, which

18
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:48,240
is that place where I'm going to be able to interact

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,280
and where I can load that information in before I do

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,010
that interaction, and as we'll see later on,

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,850
an integrated debugger.

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,560
And I want to show you just an example

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,980
of how I would use that text editor as part of the IDE.

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,517


25
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:05,850
Your own computer may have a slightly different version,

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,516
but you should be able to figure it out.

27
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:10,250
Let me simply show you an interaction on mine.

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,725
So on my computer, I have both a text file opened up

29
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:15,600
as well as the shell.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,850
And here I'm going to type in a couple of expressions.

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,060
I'm going to set x to the value 5.

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,410
And then I'm going to create a little conditional.

33
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm going to see if x is not equal to 5-- and remember,

34
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm going to close that conditional with a colon

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,300
to tell me I'm at the end of it.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,400
When I hit a carriage return, the editor automatically

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,760
indents, which is really nice.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,010
I know that the next set of things should be indented.

39
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,737
So in this case I'm going to say print out I am here.

40
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,070
I have no idea, why but it seems like a reasonable thing

41
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,970
to print out.

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,014
I hit a carriage return.

43
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,180
I'm still at the same place.

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,350
But then I'm going to put in an else clause.

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,290
And notice it nicely indents back

46
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,850
because the else should be at the same level as the if.

47
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,850
And then I'm going to say print, no I am not.

48
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,540
Now I want to run this, meaning I'd

49
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,520
like to load this information into my shell.

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,020
There are a number of ways to do it.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,510
But the easiest one is if I go up to my menu item at the top,

52
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,760
there is something called Run.

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,480
And if I click on that, it gives me a set of options,

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,790
including something called Run.

55
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,250
And I hit Run.

56
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,530
And it's going to ask me where to store that file.

57
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,196
I'm going to give it a name temporarily.

58
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:27,480


59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,600
And it said I didn't like that.

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,110
So I'm going to try it again, giving it a place

61
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,620
that I know I can store it to.

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,960
Let me do that.

63
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,530
I want to pick a particular place, save it away.

64
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,650
Oh nice.

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,130
If you now look at my shell, it's

66
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,120
actually evaluated that code.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,650
It turns out that I have other options here.

68
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,880
Under that menu I could run the entire file,

69
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,630
or I could pick something out and run just a portion of it.

70
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,760
I could select a thing using the mouse or run a line.

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,410
One of the other things I'd like to do

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,300
is to run that file multiple times.

73
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,330
So for example I could say I'm going to change x from 5 to 6.

74
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,120
And now it turns out on my machine

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,660
there's a short cut, which is just function F5.

76
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,020
It may be different on your machine.

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,450
It automatically saves the file away, executes it.

78
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,250
And again, on my shell, I've now seen a printout.

79
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,740
This is going to be really nice.

80
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,500
It's going to let me have easier ways to edit files,

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,770
edit code before I run them.

82
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,260
And so what you have then is that ability

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,660
to have both a place into which you can type things, save them

84
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,620
away, and a place in which you can then evaluate them in order

85
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,180
to do the kinds of computations we've been discussing.

86
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,679
