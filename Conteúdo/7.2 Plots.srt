0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499
...

1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,700
So our goal is actually to explore

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,940
how visualization plotting helps us think about data to see

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,700
variations in data.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,720
So let's start building on that.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,562
Suppose I want to display all four

6
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:13,800
of the graphs of the different orders of growth

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,290
all at the same time.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,910
A simple way to do it-- I just call plot

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,620
with each of those lists as the y

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,310
values-- the linear one, the quadratic one, the cubic one,

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,720
and the exponential.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,536
And you'll know I'm keeping the same x

13
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:30,910
values here because I want to have the same x-coordinate.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,951
I just want to see what the different graphs look

15
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,100
like when I call those.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,510
So if I were to execute this in my computer,

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,228
I get a display like this.

18
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:44,390
Hmm, not quite what I wanted.

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,690
And that's part of what we want you to see.

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,140
You can see here that there are at least three graphs overlaid.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,737
You can guess that this one out here is probably

22
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:53,570
the exponential one.

23
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,960
It's growing really fast.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,200
That is probably the cubic one.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,550
But you'll notice down at the bottom, what happened

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,410
to the other two graphs?

27
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,730
Well, in fact, it's impossible to see the linear graph

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,730
here or even, frankly, the quadratic one.

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,590
If you look closely, you can see a very slight red line

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,670
down there.

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,370
And that's because the scales of these graphs change so rapidly.

32
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,970
Remember, I'm graphing things with an x-axis from 0 to 29.

33
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,310
So the linear graph only goes up to 29.

34
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,206
And notice the scale here goes up to 140,000.

35
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,830
That's part of what we want to look at.

36
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,120
How do we change things so we can actually visualize data?

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,120
And the first thing we can take from this is, boy, exponential

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,790
grows really fast and certainly, a great deal

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,020
faster than linear.

40
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,630
OK, how might we think about doing the display so we can

41
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,397
see things a little bit better?

42
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,980
As we said, it's not helpful because I

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,190
can't see things because the biggest plot just

44
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,590
grows too fast.

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,880
So could I graph each one separately?

46
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,500
And the answer is sure.

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,672
I'm simply going to call another function called figure.

48
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:58,420
And I'm going to give it an argument.

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,920
And that argument simply gives a name to this figure.

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
It's going to allow me to generate

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,952
different windows, different displays, for different graphs.

52
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,910
And in fact, I'm going to be able to refer back

53
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,090
to that figure if I want to do other things inside of it.

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,370
Let's look at how that might help my problem here.

55
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,130
The idea is that when I call plt.figure,

56
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,690
if I call it without argument for the first time,

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,630
it's going to generate a new display with that name.

58
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,520
If a display already exists with that name,

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,600
it's going to reopen it and let me do additional processing

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,910
inside of it.

61
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,340
And let's look at an example.

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,357
So here are my four calls to my plots as I did before.

63
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,190
In the previous case, I just called them all

64
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,160
and they overlaid all those plots inside

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,410
of the same graph or display.

66
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,820
But now, I've added a call in between each one of them,

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,380
saying, in the figure with name lin,

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm going to do the linear one.

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,540
In a new figure with name quad, I'm

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,200
going to do the quadratic one, and similarly for cube and expo

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,470
for exponential.

72
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,570
I'm creating four different displays, each one

73
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,370
with its own plot inside.

74
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,760
So that lets us then see things like this.

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Here, calling plt.figure figure of lin

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,260
opened up a window, or a graph, with the name lin,

77
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,580
inside of which I plotted my samples and my linear.

78
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,290
And I get that nice graph of a straight linear line

79
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,430
with the range only going up to 30

80
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,910
because that was the maximum size of something

81
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,240
inside of that graph.

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,380
When I call plt.figure with expo,

83
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,460
that has now a new window with the name expo inside of it.

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,170
And when I call plot of my samples and my exponential,

85
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,710
it gives me a different graph.

86
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,620
The range here is automatically set

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,870
to be the largest value I need to show the same thing.

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,802
That's 140,000.

89
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:49,510
But now, we can compare those two graphs.

90
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,690
I can see the effects of these two different displays

91
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,480
inside of each window without having them, if you like,

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,050
buried one very tiny inside of a second one

93
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,050
inside of the same window.

94
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,830
So I could plot on separate graphs.

95
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,950
That's nice.

96
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,530
What else might I do?

97
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,360
Well, we'll look at that in the next section.
